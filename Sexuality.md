# Is Zoosexuality Really a Sexuality?

Sexuality is strictly a human concept. As such, the explicit definition of a sexuality may be 
blurred. You may choose, personally, to say that sexuality does not even exist. However, zoophilia
does check the boxes of a generally accepted definition of a sexuality. This is supported by, for
example, the International Society of Anthrozoology publication, 
*Bestiality and Zoophilia: Sexual Relations with Animals* (Anthony L. Podberscek, et al.):

> [Zoosexuality] implies a sexual orientation toward animals (Fox 1994; Tanka 1995; Shepherd 1996;
Stasya 1996). And Donofrio (1996) reported that the concept of zoophilia being a sexual orientation
was supported by his doctoral study. 

Furthermore, similar passages can be found too in *Understanding Bestiality and Zoophilia*
(Hani Miletski, Ph.D.).
