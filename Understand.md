# Can Animals Understand Humans?

Many mammals, as well as other species, can interpret human body-language, and some can learn words.
From the abstract of a research article *Dogs recognize dog and human emotions*
(Natalia Albuquerque, et al. - Royal Society Publishing){% sup %}[[0]](#ref0){% endsup %}:

> Using a cross-modal preferential looking paradigm, we presented dogs with either human or dog
faces with different emotional valences (happy/playful versus angry/aggressive) paired with a single
vocalization from the same individual with either a positive or negative valence or Brownian noise.
Dogs looked significantly longer at the face whose expression was congruent to the valence of
vocalization, for both conspecifics and heterospecifics, an ability previously known only in humans.
**These results demonstrate that dogs can extract and integrate bimodal sensory emotional information,
and discriminate between positive and negative emotions from both humans and dogs.**

> These results show that domestic dogs can obtain dog and human emotional information from both
auditory and visual inputs, and integrate them into a coherent perception of emotion[...].
Therefore, it is likely that dogs possess at least the mental prototypes for emotional categorization
(positive versus negative affect) and can recognize the emotional content of these expressions.
**Moreover, dogs performed in this way without any training or familiarization with the models,
suggesting that these emotional signals are intrinsically important.**

Furthermore, in *Human-like social skills in dogs?* (Brian Hare, Michael Tomasello -
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology){% sup %}[[1]](#ref1){% endsup %}, it's noted
that domestic dogs are "unusually skilled" at reading human emotions and behavior, comprehending
more than even man's closes primate relatives. In fact, there are recorded cases of them learning
not only words of a language, but its grammar.{% sup %}[[2]](#ref2){% endsup %}

> **She's learned that common nouns can identify different things. Ball could mean any
round or bouncy object, Frisbee any spinning disk or ring. And she can make inferences. If asked to
fetch a new toy with a word she's never heard, she'll pick the toy out from a pile of familiar ones.**
As her language learning grew, so did the experiment. **Pilley has recently started to teach Chaser
commands with three elements of grammar, going from the basic "take ball" to "take ball to Frisbee."
This is what excites Pilley most as a scientist â€” that Chaser understands the concept that words
play off of one another and that each word in a sentence can have a different meaning.**

And it's not just anecdotal - Chaser herself is the focus of a later study, *Border collie
comprehends object names as verbal referents* (John W. Pilley, Alliston K. Reid).{% sup %}[[3]](#ref3){% endsup %}
Which concludes just as the news does - she has a firm understanding of not only words, but relatively
complicated *sentences*.
