# Can Animals Consent to Sex?

Animals can give consent to us just as they, as most other mammals do, to each other - non-verbally.
Specific behaviour may depend on species, gender, and simply the individual personality of the
animal; but for example, in the case of female domestic dogs, general "soliciting behavior" includes
physical contact, and in the case of no apparent interest from the male, "the bitch will present the
perineum with the tail up to the male's nose".{% sup %}[[0]](#ref0){% endsup %}

> If the male shows minimal interest, the bitch may continue the teasing behavior by sniffing and
licking the male’s anogenital area and by investigating his face, inguinal area, and penis.{% sup %}[[0]](#ref0){% endsup %}

Obviously, animals cannot give *informed* consent. This, simply, is because informed consent is purely
a legal concept and is not present in any situation, human or not, outside of a synthetic societal
belief. Legally, sex with a drunk person, even with consent, is most always rape, regardless of the
persons continued consent after the fact. Morally, it doesn't present any issues - its immorality
stems from the presumed lack of language comprehension and decision-making.

# Do Animals Find Sex Pleasurable?

Of course! It is commonly believed that all non-human animals have sex exclusively for reproduction,
however, in fact, some papers conclude that animals may actually have a higher regard, or
understanding, of the pleasure of sex rather than its reproductive ability.

> However, we do not subscribe to another often-expressed view—that animals, unlike humans, have
sexual interactions only for reproduction, not for pleasure. On the contrary, in all likelihood
humans are the only species that understand the reproductive consequences of sex. Animals can be
presumed to engage in sex primarily for pleasure. (*Male Sexual Behavior - Elaine M. Hull, et al.)

Furthermore, a plethora animals exhibit homosexual behaviour—between both males and females—and
*especially* in primates.{% sup %}[[2]](#ref2){% endsup %} Obviously, homosexual relations don't
result in any reproduction, leaving simple *pleasure* as the only motive.
