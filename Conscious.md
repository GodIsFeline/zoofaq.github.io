# Are Animals Conscious Like Us?

For animals too dissimilar to us, like insects, we don't know. For animals we typically have
relationships with, *yes*. The way emotions and thoughts form in all mammals and birds are thought
to be very similar, making intelligence the only limiting factor.

The research about animal conciousness is not incredibly common, but one significant document is *The*
*Cambridge Declaration on Conciousness*{% sup %}[[0]](#ref0){% endsup %},
a document written by "a prominent international group of cognitive neuroscientists,*
*neuropharmacologists, neurophysiologists, neuroanatomists and computational neuroscientists" and
published in 2012. It notes:

> Birds appear to offer, in their behaviour, neurophysiology, and neuroanatomy a striking case of
parallel evolution of consciousness. Evidence of near human-like levels of consciousness has been
most dramatically observed in African grey parrots. **Mammalian and avian emotional networks and 
cognitive microcircuitries appear to be far more homologous than previously thought.**

Furthermore, *Comparing the Emotional Brains of Humans and Other Animals* (Kent C. Berridge et al. - Oxford University Press)
{% sup %}[[1]](#ref1){% endsup %} concludes that, from prefrontal cortex to brain stem, there is
"no qualitative difference between humans and other animals".
