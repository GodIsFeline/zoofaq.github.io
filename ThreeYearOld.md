# Isn't a Dog's Brain like a Three Year-Old's?

It isn't uncommon to see claims that a dog's brain is equivalent in capacity to that of a
two-to-three year old human.{% sup %}[[0]](#ref0){% endsup %} A significant flaw with such a claim,
especially in terms of sexual relations, is that their "three-year-old brain" is a measure of their
intelligence, like their ability to count, remember words, or play tricks, ***not*** a measure of
their sexual maturity. While an adult dog may not be able to count as high as a five year-old, they
have a much deeper understanding (that is, an understanding at all) of the concept of sex and the
pleasure it brings. For more on a dogs comprehension of deriving pleasure from sex, see

and [Can Animals Consent to Sex?](Sex.md#can-animals-consent-to-sex).
